Project Description:
TaskTracker is a web application used for task tracking and project management. This project enables users to easily track tasks, update task statuses, and collaborate with team members.

Features:

Users can create, edit, and delete projects along with the tasks associated with them.
Each task can have a title, description, due date, priority level, and assigned team member.
The application provides a user-friendly interface to view and update task statuses (e.g., to-do, in progress, completed).
Users can add comments, attachments, and labels to tasks to provide additional context and information.
The project dashboard offers an overview of project progress, including task completion percentages and upcoming deadlines.
Notifications and reminders are sent to team members for task assignments, due dates, and updates.
The application supports user roles and permissions, allowing project managers to assign tasks and control access.
Technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a frontend framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js)
Backend: a server-side language (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby) and a web framework (e.g., Express, Django, Ruby on Rails)
Database: a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase)
Authentication and authorization: a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT, OAuth) for user login and access control
Version control: Git for code management and collaboration
This project aims to streamline task management and enhance collaboration within teams. By creating a GitHub repository for the project, you can share the source code, collaborate with contributors, and track the development progress using Git's version control features.
